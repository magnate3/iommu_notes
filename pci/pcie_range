there are:

I/O bar
32bit mem bar
64bit mem bar
prefchable 64bit mem bar

so we should assign related windows for every kind of bar. 
if we have 256MB memory for one PCIe host bridge, how to divide it to I/O window,
32bit mem window, 64bit mem window and 64bit mem window.

let's firstly take a look at the principle we should follow when assigning
above resource windows.

/* Fix me: it is better to find some code in PCI subsystem to support below principles */
1. assign I/O bar from I/O window ?

2. 32bit mem bar can only be assigned under 32bit mem window ?

3. 64bit mem bar can only be assigned under 64bit mem window ?

4. ...

5. pci address for our PCIe host bridge is 0~0xffff_ffff_ffff_ffff

/* it is strange to assign 256MB to PCIe host, but 0x20_0000_0000 */
6. cpu address for our PCIe host bridge is 0x220_0000_0000~0x220_1000_0000 for PCIe1
   cpu address for our PCIe host bridge is 0x240_0000_0000~0x240_1000_0000 for PCIe2

/* should find related PCIe standard to support below */
7. if size of Bar is  0x1000, pci address is A in ranges item in dts, it should
   not be (A && 0xfff) < 0x1000. if so, will appear resouce conflict log.
