8. build backup server
http://www.iteye.com/topic/604436
a. pid file needs to be: /var/run/rsyncd.pid;
b. need to set /etc/default/rsync: 
   RSYNC_ENABLE=true
c. if something is wrong, go to /var/log/rsyncd.log to check
d. run sudo /etc/init.d/rsync start to start the server daemon
e. rsync daemon runs at our main server, and rsync command runs
   at backup server.

   (some ways to solve problem about auth failed on module xxx)

steps:
1. configure /etc/rsyncd.conf in server, need to touch a file yourself.
2. configure /home/wangzhou/security/rsync.pass in server indicating client's
   user name and key.
3. configure /etc/default/rsync: RSYNC_ENABLE=true in server
4. sudo /etc/init.d/rsync start in server
5. run rsync -vzrtopg --progress htsat@10.1.1.101::test /home/htsat in client
   (backup server) to backup /home/test indicating in [test] in /etc/rsyncd.conf
   in server to /home/htsat in client, using user htsat

9. after configure ldap client, you maybe can not login. at this time
   you need run sudo /etc/init.d/nscd restart
