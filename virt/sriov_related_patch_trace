Now a linaro guy Eric Auger is doing PCIe SR-IOV support, but he tested his patchset on AMD Overdrive HW (GICv2m, not GICv3).

At lease, below patchset will be involved in PCIe SR-IOV support:
Eric Auger's patchset:(kernel)
[PATCH v9 0/7] KVM PCIe/MSI passthrough on ARM/ARM64: kernel part 3/3: vfio changes --> v12
[PATCH v9 0/8] KVM PCIe/MSI passthrough on ARM/ARM64: kernel part 2/3: msi changes --> v12
[PATCH v8 0/8] KVM PCIe/MSI passthrough on ARM/ARM64: kernel part 1/3: iommu changes --> v12

Eric Auger's patchset:(qemu)
[Qemu-arm] [RFC v2 0/8] KVM PCI/MSI passthrough with mach-virt

Host ITS virtualization:
[PATCH v4 00/56] KVM: arm/arm64: Rework virtual GIC emulation --> accepted ?
[PATCH v4 00/12] KVM: arm64: GICv3 ITS emulation(which is based on the patchset above) --> update to v7

Qemu ITS emulator:
[Qemu-devel] [RFC PATCH v3 0/5] vITS support --> take by Eric Auger

Qemu GICv3 emulator:
[Qemu-devel] [PATCH v3 00/20] GICv3 emulation
