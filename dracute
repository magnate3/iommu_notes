dracut in redhat server system
------------------------------

-v0.1 2017.5.23 Sherlock init


When installing Redhat ISO into D05, the installed ISO system can not boot.
The reason is that there is some problem in dracut.

This doc tried to tell what dracut is and how it works.


When a Linux system booting, it firstly mounts initramfs and loads the necessary
modules in it. If there is a basic module which we need but not in the initramfs,
boot will be failed.

Above initramfs has been created automatically using a userspace tool called
dracut in Redhat or Suse system during the process of ISO installation. dracut
will analyze the hardware module in the machine and pick up related Linux ko in
the ISO.

When install a kernel rpm package to system, it also uses dracut to create the
initramfs.


NOTE:

- lsinitrd can be used to list the files in initramfs
- to extract initramfs, first rename it to initramfs.gz, use gunzip to extract,
  then use cpio -ivmd < initramfs.img to extract
