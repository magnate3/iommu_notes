2. SPI are connected to re-distributor
3. system registers v.s. memory-mapped
4. gic v3 supports system register interface
5. interrupt identify

7. distributor, re-distributor and ITS all support virtualization
8. active state and DIR (page. 23) ?
9. MBI interrupt can be reported as a SPI

11. in gic v3, ARE, security state, non-security state seem important

12. 4.9.26 is flow of interrupt or flow of building all map ?
